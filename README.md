In this project, weâ€™ve trained five machine learning algorithms on an intrusion detection dataset and analyzed their performance. Most of the intrusion detection datasets are multiclass and highly imbalanced in nature. The previous studies mostly relied on accuracy and false alarm rate as their performance matrices. We have analyzed the validity of those evaluation matrices and selected the proper matrices to evaluate a 
multiclass imbalanced dataset. At last, we also discussed the effectiveness of machine learning classifiers in intrusion detection systems. 
The corresponcing research was published in  IEEE 8th International Conference on Recent Advances and Innovations in Engineering (ICRAIE), DOI: 10.1109/ICRAIE59459.2023.10468177
